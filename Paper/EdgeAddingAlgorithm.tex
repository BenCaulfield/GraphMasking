\indent The edge-adding algorithm, as shown in figure \ref{fig:edge-adding}, is a greedy algorithm which find a graph $G = (V,E)$ that approximately satify a given k-neighborhood graph, $G_k = (V, E')$. The algorithm works to find a graph whose k-neighborhood is at least a subgraph of $G_k$. It begins by adding the edges of $G_k$ into a working list. We know any satisfying graph must be a subgraph of $G_k$, as every edge of a graph must be included in the k-neighborhood of that graph. Therefore, we want to find a subset of our working list that satisfies $G_k$. This algorithm works by iteratively adding edges from the working list to the new graph.  At each iteration, a random edge $(u,v)$ is selected and removed from the working list. A breadth-first search of length $k$ is run from both $u$ and $v$ in the current graph, $G$. If the search (say, from $u$) reaches a node that is not adjacent to $u$ in $G_k$, then we know adding $(u,v)$ to $G$ would invalidate the graph and the edge is discarded. If no such node is found, then $(u,v)$ is added to $G$. This process continues until the working list is empty. This algorithm runs in $O(|E|*d^k)$ time, where $d$ is the maximum node density. As social networking graphs are typically sparse, this algorithm runs in near-linear time. \\
