\indent A k-neighborhood graph of a given graph, $G$, has an edge between two nodes if there is a path of length $k$ or less between the nodes in $G$. This paper studies the problem of finding a graph that satisfies a given k-neighborhood graph.  We present two algorithms which attempt to solve this problem. The first algorithm greedily adds edges to a graph until no edges can be added without invalidating a k-neighborhood. The second algorithm randomizes a given graph while maintaining k-neighborhoods. This algorithm does not always fully randomize the graph, so we present a better randomizing heuristic that invalidates some k-neighborhoods. All of our algorithms are tested on communication data from LinkedIn. We also run a simulation on this data to determine the minimum k value that can be applied so that edges from an original graph can not be determined from a given k-neighborhood graph.
