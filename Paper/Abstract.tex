\indent Given a graph $G(V,E)$ and a natural number $k$, we define the $k-Neighborhood$  graph of G to be $G_k(V, E_k)$, where the edge $(u,v)$ in $E$ is in $E_k$ if and only if there is a path $(u,v)$ of length less than or equal to $k$ in $G$. We would like to find a $masking$ of $G$, $G'$, such that $G$ and $G'$ share a $K-neighborhood$ graph, but no edges in $G$ can be determined by studying $G'$ ($G'$ is sufficiently random). This paper provides two heuristic algorithms to solve this problem. The first modifies $G$ to get a new graph which is guaranteed to share a $k-Neighborhood$ with $G$, but may not be sufficiently random. The second algorithm builds the new graph by continuously adding edges to an originally empty graph. The new graph is sufficiently random from the original graph, but may not share the same $k-Neighborhood$.
