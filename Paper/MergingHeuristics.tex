\section{Merging Heuristics}
\indent Unfortunately, although the label-swapping algorithm yields perfectly satisfying graphs, it often doesn't sufficiently disguise a given graph.  In this section, we present a heuristic, called \emph{adjacency group merges} (or simply \emph{merges}) that further randomizes a given graph, but is not guaranteed to maintain the same k-neighborhood.

\begin{definition}
\noindent A \emph{merging} of a graph's adjacency groups combines similar adjacency groups into larger groups containing the union of their nodes based on their \emph{difference}. The difference between adjacency groups $A$ and $B$ is the size of the symmetric difference of $N_k(v)$ and $N_k(u)$, for $v \in A$ and $u \in B$. 
\end{definition}

\subsection{Non-Deterministic Merging}

\begin{definition}
An \emph{adjacency group merging} maps every pair of nodes to  the differencence value between their adjacency groups and merges adjacency groups of the first n that have not been involved in a previous merge.
